Part 2: Monitoring Print Services

> Objective: Familiarize yourself with monitoring tools available in
> Windows Server 2019.
>
> 1\. Event Viewer:
>
> o Open Event Viewer (run eventvwr.msc).
>
> o Navigate to Applications and Services Logs \> Microsoft \> Windows
> \> PrintService.
>
> o Review logs for print jobs, errors, and warnings.
>
> 2\. Performance Monitor:
>
> o Open Performance Monitor (run perfmon).
>
> o In the left pane, expand Data Collector Sets \> System.
>
> o Right-click System Performance and select Start.
>
> o Monitor performance metrics related to print services.
>
> 3\. Using Print Management Console:
>
> o Open Print Management from Server Manager.

> o View active print jobs and their status.
>
> o Use the Printers node to check the status of all printers.
>
> Part 3: Exploring Third-Party Monitoring Tools
>
> 1\. Research at least two third-party print monitoring tools
>
> o Consider factors such as features, pricing, and compatibility with
> Windows Server 2019.
>
> 2\. Install and Configure:
>
> o Choose one of the tools to install in your environment.
>
